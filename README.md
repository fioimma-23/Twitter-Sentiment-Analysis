# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A Python-based sentiment analysis project that classifies tweets into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** categories using machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets using text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and supervised learning models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

It’s ideal for understanding public opinion, trend analysis, and customer feedback on Twitter.

## 📊 Features

- 📥 Twitter data ingestion (CSV-based)
- 🧹 Text cleaning (stopwords, stemming, punctuation)
